			<li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:26</p> <p class="message">Of course! Happy to help! Thank you for inviting me onto this interview! Have a great rest of your day! üôÇ</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:25</p> <p class="message">Oh! So that is my end of questions! Your answers were very deep and thoughtful and interesting! Thanks a lot for giving your highly valuable time to me. Have a good night!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:24</p> <p class="message">YouTube started off as a hobby for me. With the channel really starting to take off within the past year, it has since turned into my full time job, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful that it is. üôÇ</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:23</p> <p class="message">That is a pretty good advice! My last and 12th question is do you do YouTube as a side thing / a hobby or a full time career?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:21</p> <p class="message">Also have the ambition to learn new things. You will learn, constantly. Your first video might stink, and that&#x27;s okay! Take it as a learning opportunity to do better in the next video. Even if you&#x27;re already popular, take a step back and evaluate your latest video and see what things you can change to improve it. Make sure your Search Engine Optimization is good, your thumbnails are good, your channel has a specific high-demand, low-supply niche that it follows, make sure your videos are high quality, etc.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:19</p> <p class="message">Oh! My eleventh question is what advice would you want to give to those who are trying to become a YouTuber?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:18</p> <p class="message">I love to listen to music and to watch TV and movies. Those are things that always give me inspiration and ideas for what other kind of content I can make. I also enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also love to do research on world history, which is another big inspiration too. As for other hobbies, I like to write, though I probably don&#x27;t do it as much as I should. I also like to paint, but I don&#x27;t do it a whole lot.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:15</p> <p class="message">Oh! My tenth question is when you‚Äôre not working on a YouTube video, what do you love to do the most?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:14</p> <p class="message">Yes, quite a few times haha. I have dealt with occasional instances where my content upset people and even had them get angry with me personally. The best thing to do in that case is just stay above it and, if necessary, learn from the situation and see what you could do better going forward. It can be tempting to derail from that, but taking the higher road is typically what&#x27;s most important.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:11</p> <p class="message">Oh! My ninth question is that have you ever had opposition in your career?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:10</p> <p class="message">I just made the name up. Oddly enough, I was watching a YouTube channel that was popular at that time called Wafflepwn. I thought the videos were hilarious and thought maybe I could do something silly like that with my brother. What username is equally as ridiculous? NationSquid. The name just sort of popped up in my head. The channel never took off with its intended purpose, so I started creating the content that would eventually take me to where I am today.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:08</p> <p class="message">I am really sorry, Haha, actually I am taking a interview reference from other YouTuber, so I didn&#x27;t change it, sorry.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:06</p> <p class="message">Right! My eight question is where did you get the name ‚ÄúNationSquid‚Äù from?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:05</p> <p class="message">I would really love to go back to the original 2008 design, as silly as that sounds. The YouTube with the star ratings, yellow subscribe button, and the custom CSS youtube channels! A lot of that is definitely nostalgia based, but the layout was also specifically designed to cater to the creator and give them the tools to *really* express themselves in the most creative way possible. Nothing can beat the CSS YouTube channels!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 07:04</p> <p class="message">That was very intresting! My seventh question is if you had the power to change something about YouTube, what would it be?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 07:02</p> <p class="message">They do! To tell the truth, I am one of those people that doesn&#x27;t like hearing or seeing myself on the TV or computer screen haha! So when they are watching one of my videos I tend to leave the room haha. I heard Johnny Depp does the same thing though! Funny story, my little cousin went to show me a video once at a family get together (it was my I Love You virus video and she showed it to me just because she liked it and wanted to share it with me). That video was back when I still used my pitch changer, so she did not know it was me. I had the thrill of telling her that she was watching my video and she was all amazed haha! It was the cutest thing.

My cousin&#x27;s girlfriend also has a brother who watches my channel and had no idea that his sister was dating my cousin! So that was interesting to hear about too haha.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:59</p> <p class="message">Wow! My sixth question is do your family-members watch your videos? If yes, what is their reaction when they do so?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:57</p> <p class="message">So I actually had a couple of videos take off at that time! I had my I Love You virus video see live numbers that I had never seen before, despite the video being a year and a half old at that point, and I had my You Are an Idiot video, and my Goggle video take off at that same time. I even had Penguinz0 react to one of them, which was a lot of fun and serves as great bragging rights when at lunch with friends haha! Not too long after, my Y2K video hit half a million views in just two days. The channel analytics that week was definitely one of the best Christmas presents I&#x27;ve had in a while. üôÇ</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:53</p> <p class="message">Yes, you are correct! My fifth question is that what specific video you think made your channel go from 88K to 200K in 4 months?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:51</p> <p class="message">So there were a couple of things that happened there. There were some videos that came out in between that time. I just privated them for a lot of reasons, so the break was not as big as it looks now, but there was a break. 

One factor was me starting college at that time, which demanded much more of my attention than before. Another reason was that I needed to step away to do some self-reflecting. To tell the truth, I had made some bad decisions at that time and that got me into trouble, so I also took the time to reflect and learn how I could grow from those mistakes and use my content for the better. I‚Äôd like to say that this decision helped me immensely, both with YouTube and with growing to become a better person.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:47</p> <p class="message">Oh! My fourth question is you&#x27;ve had taken a 2 year pause or a break after the &quot;Day the Music Died&quot; video. Why did you do it? Were you unhappy by your growth? What made you come back?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:45</p> <p class="message">I was pretty faithful that i could pull it off. My channel remained stagnant for a couple of years, and there were times where I felt lost or felt like giving up, but in all honesty, I really did still see light at the end of the tunnel. That didn‚Äôt really change for me, and I‚Äôm thankful for that, because that was a huge factor which drove my ambition.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:44</p> <p class="message">Wow! My third question is did you ever think you would have as many subscribers as you do now?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:43</p> <p class="message">The money. Haha. 
But also, the relationship you get to build with your audience. Nothing makes me more happy than having the privilege to connect with people who have the exact same interests and hobbies as me and being able to entertain them, and have that be my job!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:41</p> <p class="message">Oh! I also liked the World Trade Center video! My third question is what do you think is the best part of being a YouTuber is?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:40</p> <p class="message">Probably the video on the World Trade Center. That was my first time really using the 3D modeling program Blender for a YouTube video, and being able to create all of New York City just through a computer program and revive a part of America that no longer exists was both incredible and very emotional for me. 

I also loved my video on the Day the Music Died. A very tragic story that focused on three musicians that have had such a significant impact on my life, and that video gave me a chance to further connect with them as human beings.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:37</p> <p class="message">Wow! My second question is do you have a favourite video you created? If yes, which one?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:36</p> <p class="message">So I first discovered YouTube in late 2007, but did not really pay any mind to it, aside from my older brother showing me a strange or funny video every now and then. It wasn‚Äôt until my brother started making his own content on the site that I started getting interested. I thought his videos were hilarious and his channel really inspired me to start creating my own content. I really began navigating the site pretty much daily in late 2008 and started making my own content in early 2009. Although I was significantly inspired by my brother, I was also inspired by other creators of the time such as Fred, Shane Dawson, Jigitz, HouseHoldHacker, just to name a few. I‚Äôve hopped back and forth from different YouTube channels, but I‚Äôve kept going ever since!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:31</p> <p class="message">Great! My first question will be how and when did you discover YouTube?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:31</p> <p class="message">Sounds good! Whenever you‚Äôre ready.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:31</p> <p class="message">Yes. So should we start with the questions?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">Onosideboard#4794</p><p class="time">Today at 06:30</p> <p class="message">Doing well! Thank you. Hope you‚Äôre doing well too. üôÇ</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 06:30</p> <p class="message">Okay then. Hey &lt;@!522882704971268096&gt; , hope you are doing good!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Zira#9472</p><p class="time">Today at 06:30</p> <p class="message">Event Reminder for &quot;Interview with NationSquid&quot; @here.
